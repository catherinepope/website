Hello. I’m Catherine Pope, a technical trainer.

I enjoy mastering difficult concepts and helping other people understand them.

With an extensive background in industry and academia, I’ve created training materials in a range of formats, including user guides, books, and video-based courses.

Before becoming a technical trainer, I worked for many years as an IT manager/web developer (part of it in the finance industry), and also as a university lecturer specialising in Victorian literature. Yes, it’s an odd combination. However, I’m now bringing together my love of learning, teaching, and technology.

I work in DevOps, creating and delivering training solutions for engineers on topics including Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD. All views here are my own and don't represent my employer.

In the tiny amount of time that’s left, I manage [Victorian Secrets](https://www.victoriansecrets.co.uk), a micro press dedicated to books from and about the nineteenth century.

I live in Brighton on the south coast of England with my partner Tanya, two stripy cats, and thousands of books.
