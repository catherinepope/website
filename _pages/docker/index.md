## Introduction

I'm currently working towards the [Docker Certified Associate (DCA)](https://training.mirantis.com/certification/dca-certification-exam/) qualification. To help me retain this information, I'll be adding overviews of key Docker concepts and features here.

- What is Docker?
- Installing Docker
- Pulling Images and Running a Container
- [Creating an Image](./creating-docker-images/)
- [Pushing an Image to a Registry](./pushing-docker-images/)
- [Managing Images](./managing-docker-images/)
- Using Docker Compose
- Using Storage in Docker
- Using Docker Swarm
- [Networking in Docker](./networking/)
- Using Stacks
- Improving Security in Docker
- Using Kubernetes with Docker

## The DCA Examination

The exam cover six domains:

- Orchestration
- Image Creation, Management, and Registry
- Installation and Configuration
- Networking
- Security
- Storage and Volumes
