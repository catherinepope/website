## Introduction

I'm currently working towards the [Docker Certified Associate (DCA)](https://training.mirantis.com/certification/dca-certification-exam/) qualification. To help me retain this information, I'll be adding overviews of key Docker concepts and features here.

- What is Docker?
- [Installing Docker](./installation/)
- [Pulling Images](./pulling-docker-images/)
- [Running Containers](./running-containers/)
- [Creating an Image](./creating-docker-images/)
- [Pushing an Image to a Registry](./pushing-docker-images/)
- [Managing Images](./managing-docker-images/)
- [Using Docker Compose](./docker-compose/)
- [Using Storage in Docker](./storage/)
- [Using Docker Swarm](./docker-swarm/)
- [Creating and Managing Services in Docker Swarm](./swarm-services/)
- [Networking in Docker](./networking/)
- [Using Stacks](./docker-stacks/)
- Improving Security in Docker
- Using Kubernetes with Docker

## The DCA Examination

The exam cover six domains:

- Orchestration
- Image Creation, Management, and Registry
